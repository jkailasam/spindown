To make an installation type:
  # make
  # make install

Before you can run it you'll need to copy the spindown.conf.example file to
/etc/spindown.conf and adapt it to your needs. You can run the deamon like this:
  # /etc/init.d/spindown start

You can also get the status as following:
  # /etc/init.d/spindown status

If you would like to work on the code you can run the daemon from the source
directory. It will then look for all the files in that location.
